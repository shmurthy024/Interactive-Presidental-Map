# Interactive-Presidental-Map
Using Plotly Dash I created an interactive presidential map that shows the results of all elections from 1976-2016. The map is interactive and shows the voting splits for candidates and winner is displayed at the top every time you change the year.
The dashboard is created entirely from python with elements of HTML and CSS. From this project I learned a lot about Plotly Dash and how I can only use Python to create a fully functional dashboard and not stress over learning HTML, CSS, and/or JS. I will definetly use this platform more in the future since it is easy and stress-free.
